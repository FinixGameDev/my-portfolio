                Hi! I'm Diogo Rocha aka Finix, and this is my portfolio. I'm a young game developer and game designer from Portugal and I recently graduated from
                <a href="https://ipca.pt">IPCA</a> studying Digital Games Development & Engineering.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're here, chances are you have heard my story a thousand times: I started my gaming journey pretty much in diapers, playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GD5mzJ7UrhA">Max Payne</a> on my dad's laptop, I then
                found my calling to game development at 14 when my middle school friends introduced me to the <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity Engine</a> and so I've been learning about game dev and loving the medium
                ever since.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways... here you can find some of the <a href="#game">games</a> and game development <a href="#tool">tools</a> I've developed on my own, and some of the projects I had the pleasure of having a team to work with.

                        recursive backtracker algorithms for the map data generation as well as two instatiation methods. For gameplay reasons
                        it also supports modifiers that change tiles based on the game rules.
